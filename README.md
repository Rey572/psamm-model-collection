PSAMM model collection
======================

This is a collection of published GEMs that have been converted to the file
format used by [PSAMM](https://github.com/zhanglab/psamm), using the
[psamm-import tool](https://github.com/zhanglab/psamm-import).

The collection of models is split into two sections:

- [**sbml**](sbml): Models that have been loaded as SBML files using the _sbml_
  loader in _psamm-import_.
- [**excel**](excel): Models that have been loaded using a model-specific Excel
  file loader in _psamm-import_.
